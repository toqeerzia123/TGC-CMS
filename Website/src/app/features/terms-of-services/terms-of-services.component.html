                         <p style="margin-left: 20px;">b.

You agree that if TGC does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the terms (or which TGC has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of TGC's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to TGC.</p>
                         <p style="margin-left: 20px;">e.

The remaining provisions of the terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</p>
                         <p style="margin-left: 20px;">f. You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which TGC is the parent shall be third party beneficiaries to the terms and that such other companies shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries to the term.</p>
                         <p style="margin-left: 20px;">g. The terms, and your relationship with TGC under the terms, shall be governed by the laws in the United Kingdom without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and TGC agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the the United Kingdom to resolve any legal matter arising from the terms. Notwithstanding this, you agree that TGC shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
